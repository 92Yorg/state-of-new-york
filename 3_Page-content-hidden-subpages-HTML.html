			New York City has always been at the forefront of culture, politics, and
			arts. As a global epicenter, New York City&rsquo;s vibrant arts and
			culture scene attracts and keeps millions of people every year. After
			surviving a global pandemic, New York City faces looming budget deficits,
			concerns about quality of life and a rapidly shifting economy. So we ask
			the question: what&rsquo;s next for New York?
		</p>

		<p class="page-intro">
			The State of New York, hosted by the Newmark Civic Life Series at The 92nd
			Street Y, New York, will convene conversations around the most pressing
			issues facing our City right now and how those challenges intersect and
			impact the Arts. The Series examines how issues like the housing crisis, a
			flailing education system, public safety issues, and philanthropic giving
			shape our city and its future with New York&rsquo;s leading
			decision-makers.

			New York City has always been at the forefront of culture, politics, and
			arts. As a global epicenter, New York City&rsquo;s vibrant arts and
			culture scene attracts and keeps millions of people every year. After
			surviving a global pandemic, New York City faces looming budget deficits,
			concerns about quality of life and a rapidly shifting economy. So we ask
			the question: what&rsquo;s next for New York?
		</p>

		<p class="page-intro">
			The State of New York, hosted by the Newmark Civic Life Series at The 92nd
			Street Y, New York, will convene conversations around the most pressing
			issues facing our City right now and how those challenges intersect and
			impact the Arts. The Series examines how issues like the housing crisis, a
			flailing education system, public safety issues, and philanthropic giving
			shape our city and its future with New York&rsquo;s leading
			decision-makers.
